# sentry-cli

This is a Sentry command line client for some generic tasks.  Right now this
is primarily used to upload debug symbols to Sentry if you are not using the
fastlane tools.

Binaries can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases/)

You can also install it with everybody's favorite curl to bash::

    curl https://www.getsentry.com/get-cli | bash
